{"paper_id": "1706.03762v7", "page": 2, "section": "", "text": "1 Introduction Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15]. Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional computation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc- tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2 Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence of continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. 2"}
{"paper_id": "1706.03762v7", "page": 3, "section": "", "text": "Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively. 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position- wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 . Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum 3"}

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel. of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT √dk)V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi- plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk. 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned linear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional 4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random variables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk i=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk. 4"}

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this. MultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO where head i= Attention( QWQ i, KWK i, V WV i) Where the projections are parameter matrices WQ i∈Rdmodel×dk,WK i∈Rdmodel×dk,WV i∈Rdmodel×dv andWO∈Rhdv×dmodel. In this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use dk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality. 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: •In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9]. •The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. •Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. FFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2) While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality dff= 2048 . 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor- mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel. 5"}

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9]. In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: PE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model) PE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model) where posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of PEpos. We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training. 4 Why Self-Attention In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu- tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata. One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations,"}

To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, orO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences. 5 Training This section describes the training regime for our models. 5.1 Training Data and Batching We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source- target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens. 5.2 Hardware and Schedule We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days). 5.3 Optimizer We used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula: lrate =d−0.5 model·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3) This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pdrop= 0.1. Label Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls= 0.1[36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score. 6 Results 6.1 Machine Translation On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3. For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38]. Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature.

In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads. In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model. 6.3 English Constituency Parsing To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37]. We trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting. We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

Our results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur- prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8]. In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [ 37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley- Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences. 7 Conclusion In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours. The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl- edge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem- ory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com- pare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge- intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline. 1 Introduction Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl- edge from data [ 47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down- sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [ 38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [ 20] and ORQA [ 31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [ 8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,arXiv:2005.11401v4 [cs.CL] 12 Apr 2021"}

For ﬁnal prediction y, we treatzas a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents. but have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. We endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [ 26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [ 32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [ 51] or BART, RAG can be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned. There has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric memory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64,55], stack- augmented networks [ 25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training. Our results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera- tion for knowledge-intensive tasks —tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions [ 29], WebQuestions [ 3] and CuratedTrec [ 2] and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [ 24].

Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 2 Methods We explore RAG models, which use the input sequence xto retrieve text documents zand use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models leverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x)with parameters ηthat returns (top-K truncated) distributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)parametrized 1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform- ers Library [ 66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/ examples/rag/ .

To train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence , the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token , can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the pηandpθcomponents, as well as the training and decoding procedure. 2.1 Models RAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence . Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x)via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, pRAG-Sequence (y|x)≈∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) =∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)N∏ ipθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) RAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne: pRAG-Token (y|x)≈N∏ i∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) Finally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. 2.2 Retriever: DPR The retrieval component pη(z|x)is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture: pη(z|x)∝exp( d(z)⊤q(x)) d(z) =BERTd(z),q(x) =BERTq(x) where d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8], andq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE. Calculating top-k (pη(·|x)), the list ofkdocumentszwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [ 23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory . 2.3 Generator: BART The generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use BART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input xwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions.

Updating the document encoder BERTdduring training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [ 20]. We do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERT qand the BART generator. 2.5 Decoding At test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate arg maxyp(y|x). RAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq genera- tor with transition probability: p′ θ(yi|x,y 1:i−1) =∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(zi|x)pθ(yi|x,zi,y1:i−1)To decode, we can plug p′ θ(yi|x,y 1:i−1)into a standard beam decoder. RAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood p(y|x)does not break into a conventional per- token likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for each document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses Y, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability of an hypothesis ywe run an additional forward pass for each document zfor whichydoes not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x)and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer output sequences,|Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding, we can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi)≈0whereywas not generated during beam search from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Yhas been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” 3 Experiments We experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [ 23] with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve the top kdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev data. We now discuss experimental details for each task. 3.1 Open-domain Question Answering Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [ 20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y) and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [ 5,7,31,26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions"}

We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQA (TQA) [ 24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [ 3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [ 2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [ 26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31,26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. 3.2 Abstractive Question Answering RAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4"}
{"paper_id": "2005.11401v4", "page": 5, "section": "", "text": "MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as “What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation To evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen- eration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions. Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task. We use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [ 34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. 3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation FEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with claim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks.

In both cases we report label accuracy. 4 Results 4.1 Open-domain Question Answering Table 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA tasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines the generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of \"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [ 20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross- encoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance. There are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu- ments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading 5"}

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%. 4.2 Abstractive Question Answering As shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is impressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to generate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and (iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than BART generations (see §4.5). 4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation Table 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual than RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and BART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more speciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model. Jeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows an example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The Sun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is generated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens. This observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc documents. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We"}

This example shows how parametric and non-parametric memories work together —the non-parametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory. 4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation Table 2 shows our results on FEVER.

RAG achieves an accuracy within 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence. We also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top kdocuments retrieved by RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases. 4.5 Additional Results Generation Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding [33,59,39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models.

Retrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. We compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [ 53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial. Index hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [ 5] Wikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer index from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed 7"}

Accuracy with mismatched indices is low (12% with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, 4% with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders). This shows we can update RAG’s world knowledge by simply replacing its non-parametric memory. Effect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signiﬁcant differences in performance between them. We have the ﬂexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves Open-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved documents.

{"paper_id": "2005.11401v4", "page": 9, "section": "", "text": "General-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench- marks [ 60,61] after ﬁne-tuning [ 49,8]. GPT-2 [ 50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For further improvement, BART [ 32] and T5 [ 51,52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models. Learned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44,26] similar to ours. Some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering, using search [ 46], reinforcement learning [ 6,63,62], or a latent variable approach [ 31,20] as in our work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture can be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks. Memory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [ 64,55]. Concurrent work [ 14] learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings [ 15,13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9]. Retrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including Machine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work. 6 Discussion In this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric memory.

We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks. 9"}
{"paper_id": "2005.11401v4", "page": 10, "section": "", "text": "Broader Impact This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs. With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against misleading content and automated spam/phishing.

For RAG-Sequence models, we report test results using 50 retrieved documents, and we use the Thorough Decoding approach since answers are generally short. We use greedy decoding for QA as we did not ﬁnd beam search improved results. For Open-MSMarco and Jeopardy question generation, we report test numbers using ten retrieved documents for both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence, and we also train a BART-large model as a baseline. We use a beam size of four, and use the Fast Decoding approach for RAG-Sequence models, as Thorough Decoding did not improve performance. B Human Evaluation Figure 4: Annotation interface for human evaluation of factuality. A pop-out for detailed instructions and a worked example appear when clicking \"view tool guide\". Figure 4 shows the user interface for human evaluation. To avoid any biases for screen position, which model corresponded to sentence A and sentence B was randomly selected for each example. Annotators were encouraged to research the topic using the internet, and were given detailed instruc- tions and worked examples in a full instructions tab. We included some gold sentences in order to assess the accuracy of the annotators. Two annotators did not perform well on these examples and their annotations were removed from the results. C Training setup Details We train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [ 45].2We train with mixed precision ﬂoating point arithmetic [ 40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though training and inference can be run on one GPU. We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring ∼100 GB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace Transformers [ 66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner and easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document index using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB.

{"paper_id": "2005.11401v4", "page": 18, "section": "", "text": "D Further Details on Open-Domain QA For open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training the model with each (q,a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query. CuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres- sions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20]. To overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace. TriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop- ment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [ 26], which are consistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public TriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set instead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See appendix of [ 14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches. We ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more conventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from Wikipedia. E Further Details on FEVER For FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The ﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task we explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia as evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.

F Null Document Probabilities We experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [ 20] in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if kdocuments were retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document logit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or (iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for RAG. G Parameters Our RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of DPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and 406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable 18"}

The T5 model with the closest number of parameters to our models is T5-large (770M parameters), which achieves a score of 28.9 EM on Natural Questions [ 52], substantially below the 44.5 that RAG-Sequence achieves, indicating that hybrid parametric/non- parametric models require far fewer trainable parameters for strong open-domain QA performance. The non-parametric memory index does not consist of trainable parameters, but does consists of 21M 728 dimensional vectors, consisting of 15.3B values. These can be easily be stored at 8-bit ﬂoating point precision to manage memory and disk footprints. H Retrieval Collapse In preliminary experiments, we observed that for some tasks such as story generation [ 11], the retrieval component would “collapse” and learn to retrieve the same documents regardless of the input. In these cases, once retrieval had collapsed, the generator would learn to ignore the documents, and the RAG model would perform equivalently to BART. The collapse could be due to a less-explicit requirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result in less informative gradients for the retriever. Perez et al. [46] also found spurious retrieval results when optimizing a retrieval component in order to improve performance on downstream tasks.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁne- tuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations speciﬁed purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-ﬂy reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we ﬁnd that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this ﬁnding and of GPT-3 in general. ∗Equal contribution †Johns Hopkins University, OpenAI Author contributions listed at end of paper.arXiv:2005.14165v4 [cs.CL] 22 Jul 2020"}

{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 3, "section": "", "text": "1 Introduction Recent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly ﬂexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to task-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have been directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18]. This last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons. First, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many of these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task. Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus ﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then ﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [ HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily generalize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it [YdC+19,MPL19 ]. Thus, the performance of ﬁne-tuned models on speciﬁc benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19]. Third, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural language (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number of demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often Figure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task. We use the term"}

During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within the forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a model would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded within a single sequence. 3"}
{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 4, "section": "", "text": "Figure 1.2: Larger models make increasingly efﬁcient use of in-context information. We show in-context learning performance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a natural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate improved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range of tasks. sufﬁcient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing to a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans to seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy dialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same ﬂuidity and generality. One potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1– which in the context of language models means the model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1). Recent work [ RWC+19] attempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task speciﬁcation: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next. While it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to ﬁne-tuning – for example [RWC+19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind the state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of solving language tasks. Another recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer language models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [ RNSS18 ], to 300 million parameters [DCLT18 ], to 1.5 billion parameters [ RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and ﬁnally 17 billion parameters [ Tur20 ]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream NLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a smooth trend of improvement with scale [ KMH+20]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and tasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong gains with scale. 1In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous: the method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time demonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from"}

To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning” to capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner loop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many demonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model learns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which we discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer loop structure. 4"}

See Figure 3.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP benchmark suite. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call GPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets, as well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training set. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we allow as many demonstrations as will ﬁt into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”, where we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only an instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional ﬁne-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work. Figure 1.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to remove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task description, and with the number of examples in the model’s context, K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically with model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and number of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning. Broadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot setting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held by ﬁne-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in the one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art relative to ﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting. GPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proﬁciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-ﬂy reasoning, which include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them deﬁned only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human evaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from human-generated articles. At the same time, we also ﬁnd some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3.

{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 6, "section": "", "text": "We also undertake a systematic study of “data contamination” – a growing problem when training high capacity models on datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such content often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify its distorting effects. Although we ﬁnd that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3’s performance on most datasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inﬂating results, and we either do not report results on these datasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity. In addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion parameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings. Broadly, for most tasks we ﬁnd relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap between zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models are more proﬁcient meta-learners. Finally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and broader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3’s characteristics in this regard. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our approach and methods for training GPT-3 and evaluating it. Section 3 presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings. Section 4 addresses questions of data contamination (train-test overlap). Section 5 discusses limitations of GPT-3. Section 6 discusses broader impacts. Section 7 reviews related work and Section 8 concludes. 2 Approach Our basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [ RWC+19], with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training. Our use of in-context learning is also similar to [ RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for learning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly deﬁning and contrasting the different settings that we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a spectrum of how much task-speciﬁc data they tend to rely on. Speciﬁcally, we can identify at least four points on this spectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration): •Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of a pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset speciﬁc to the desired task. Typically thousands to hundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of ﬁne-tuning is strong performance on many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential for poor generalization out-of-distribution [ MPL19 ], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the training"}

The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential for poor generalization out-of-distribution [ MPL19 ], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the training data [ GSL+18,NK19 ], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In this work we do not ﬁne-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be ﬁne-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work. •Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few demonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning [ RWC+19], but no weight updates are allowed. As shown in Figure 2.1, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example an English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving Kexamples of context and completion, and then one ﬁnal example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We typically set Kin the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can ﬁt in the model’s context window (nctx= 2048 ). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-speciﬁc data and reduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow ﬁne-tuning dataset. The main disadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models. Also, a small amount of task speciﬁc data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot learning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in ML [ HYC01 ,VBL+16] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in the pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task. •One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural language description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and zero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans. For example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical Turk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difﬁcult to communicate the content or format of a task if no examples are given. 6"}

The panels above show four methods for performing a task with a language model – ﬁne-tuning is the traditional method, whereas zero-, one-, and few-shot, which we study in this work, require the model to perform the task with only forward passes at test time. We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task descriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G. •Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given a natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for robustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of pre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difﬁcult for humans to understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases “unfairly hard”. For example, if someone is asked to “make a table of world records for the 200m dash”, this request can be ambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and even with careful clariﬁcation, understanding precisely what is desired can be difﬁcult). Nevertheless, for at least some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks – for example, in the translation example in Figure 2.1, a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction. Figure 2.1 shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French. In this paper we focus on zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, with the aim of comparing them not as competing alternatives, but as different problem settings which offer a varying trade-off between performance on speciﬁc benchmarks and sample efﬁciency. We especially highlight the few-shot results as many of them are only slightly behind state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models. Ultimately, however, one-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance, and are important targets for future work. Sections 2.1-2.3 below give details on our models, training data, and training process respectively. Section 2.4 discusses the details of how we do few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations. 7"}

All models were trained for a total of 300 billion tokens. 2.1 Model and Architectures We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 [ RWC+19], including the modiﬁed initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer [ CGRS19 ]. To study the dependence of ML performance on model size, we train 8 different sizes of model, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 125 million parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the last being the model we call GPT-3. Previous work [ KMH+20] suggests that with enough training data, scaling of validation loss should be approximately a smooth power law as a function of size; training models of many different sizes allows us to test this hypothesis both for validation loss and for downstream language tasks. Table 2.1 shows the sizes and architectures of our 8 models. Here nparams is the total number of trainable parameters, nlayers is the total number of layers, dmodel is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dﬀ= 4∗dmodel ), anddhead is the dimension of each attention head. All models use a context window of nctx= 2048 tokens. We partition the model across GPUs along both the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural parameters for each model are chosen based on computational efﬁciency and load-balancing in the layout of models across GPU’s. Previous work [ KMH+20] suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters within a reasonably broad range. 2.2 Training Dataset Datasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset2[RSR+19] constituting nearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufﬁcient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same sequence twice. However, we have found that unﬁltered or lightly ﬁltered versions of Common Crawl tend to have lower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets: (1) we downloaded and ﬁltered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference corpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy and preserve the integrity"}

Details of the ﬁrst two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix A. For the third, we added several curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [ RWC+19], collected by scraping links over a longer period of time, and ﬁrst described in [ KMH+20], two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia. Table 2.2 shows the ﬁnal mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from 41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before ﬁltering and 570GB after ﬁltering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets are not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently, such that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are sampled 2-3 times.

Based on the analysis in Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models [KMH+20] we train much larger models on many fewer tokens than is typical. As a consequence, although GPT-3 3B is almost 10x larger than RoBERTa-Large (355M params), both models took roughly 50 petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training.

As a result, when we train for 300 billion tokens, some datasets are seen up to 3.4 times during training while other datasets are seen less than once. A major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large models with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by having their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training. To reduce such contamination, we searched for and attempted to remove any overlaps with the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a bug in the ﬁltering caused us to ignore some overlaps, and due to the cost of training it was not feasible to retrain the model. In Section 4 we characterize the impact of the remaining overlaps, and in future work we will more aggressively remove data contamination. 2.3 Training Process As found in [ KMH+20,MKAT18 ], larger models can typically use a larger batch size, but require a smaller learning rate. We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size [ MKAT18 ]. Table 2.1 shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture of model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network. All models were trained on V100 GPU’s on part of a high-bandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft. Details of the training process and hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix B. 9"}

For LAMBADA and Storycloze there is no supervised training set available so we draw conditioning examples from the development set and evaluate on the test set. For Winograd (the original, not SuperGLUE version) there is only one dataset, so we draw conditioning examples directly from it. Kcan be any value from 0 to the maximum amount allowed by the model’s context window, which is nctx= 2048 for all models and typically ﬁts 10to100examples. Larger values of Kare usually but not always better, so when a separate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of Kon the development set and then run the best value on the test set. For some tasks (see Appendix G) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to (or forK= 0, instead of) demonstrations. On tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide Kexamples of context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of each completion. For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small number of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional beneﬁt as measured on the development set by normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computingP(completion|context) P(completion|answer context), where answer context is the string \"Answer: \" or\"A: \" and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer but is otherwise generic. On tasks that involve binary classiﬁcation, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. “True” or “False” rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what is done by [RSR+19] (see Appendix G) for details. On tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as [ RSR+19]: a beam width of 4 and a length penalty of α= 0.6. We score the model using F1 similarity score, BLEU, or exact match, depending on what is standard for the dataset at hand. Final results are reported on the test set when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting (zero-, one-, and few-shot). When the test set is private, our model is often too large to ﬁt on the test server, so we report results on the development set.

After extending this trend by two more orders of magnitude, we observe only a slight (if any) departure from the power-law. One might worry that these improvements in cross-entropy loss come only from modeling spurious details of our training corpus. However, we will see in the following sections that improvements in cross-entropy loss lead to consistent performance gains across a broad spectrum of natural language tasks. Below, we evaluate the 8 models described in Section 2 (the 175 billion parameter parameter GPT-3 and 7 smaller models) on a wide range of datasets. We group the datasets into 9 categories representing roughly similar tasks. In Section 3.1 we evaluate on traditional language modeling tasks and tasks that are similar to language modeling, such as Cloze tasks and sentence/paragraph completion tasks. In Section 3.2 we evaluate on “closed book” question answering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model’s parameters to answer general knowledge questions. In Section 3.3 we evaluate the model’s ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot and few-shot). In Section 3.4 we evaluate the model’s performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks. In Section 3.5 we evaluate on datasets that involve commonsense reasoning or question answering. In Section 3.6 we evaluate on reading comprehension tasks, in Section 3.7 we evaluate on the SuperGLUE benchmark suite, and in 3.8 we brieﬂy explore NLI.

We omit the 4 Wikipedia-related tasks in that work because they are entirely contained in our training data, and we also omit the one-billion word benchmark due to a high fraction of the dataset being contained in our training set. PTB escapes these issues due to predating the modern internet. Our largest model sets a new SOTA on PTB by a substantial margin of 15 points, achieving a perplexity of 20.50. Note that since PTB is a traditional language modeling dataset it does not have a clear separation of examples to deﬁne one-shot or few-shot evaluation around, so we measure only zero-shot. 3.1.2 LAMBADA The LAMBADA dataset [ PKL+16] tests the modeling of long-range dependencies in text – the model is asked to predict the last word of sentences which require reading a paragraph of context. It has recently been suggested that the continued scaling of language models is yielding diminishing returns on this difﬁcult benchmark.

We ﬁnd that path is still promising and in a zero-shot setting GPT-3 achieves 76% on LAMBADA, a gain of 8% over the previous state of the art. LAMBADA is also a demonstration of the ﬂexibility of few-shot learning as it provides a way to address a problem that classically occurs with this dataset. Although the completion in LAMBADA is always the last word in a sentence, a standard language model has no way of knowing this detail. It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but also to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word ﬁlters [ RWC+19] (which ban “continuation” words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to “frame” the task as a cloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired. We use the following ﬁll-in-the-blank format: Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend .→Bob George bought some baseball equipment, a ball, a glove, and a .→ When presented with examples formatted this way, GPT-3 achieves 86.4% accuracy in the few-shot setting, an increase of over 18% from the previous state-of-the-art. We observe that few-shot performance improves strongly with model size. While this setting decreases the performance of the smallest model by almost 20%, for GPT-3 it improves accuracy by 10%. Finally, the ﬁll-in-blank method is not effective one-shot, where it always performs worse than the zero-shot setting. Perhaps this is because all models still require several examples to recognize the pattern. 12"}

One note of caution is that an analysis of test set contamination identiﬁed that a signiﬁcant minority of the LAMBADA dataset appears to be present in our training data – however analysis performed in Section 4 suggests negligible impact on performance. 3.1.3 HellaSwag The HellaSwag dataset [ ZHB+19] involves picking the best ending to a story or set of instructions. The examples were adversarially mined to be difﬁcult for language models while remaining easy for humans (who achieve 95.6% accuracy). GPT-3 achieves 78.1% accuracy in the one-shot setting and 79.3% accuracy in the few-shot setting, outperforming the 75.4% accuracy of a ﬁne-tuned 1.5B parameter language model [ ZHR+19] but still a fair amount lower than the overall SOTA of 85.6% achieved by the ﬁne-tuned multi-task model ALUM. 3.1.4 StoryCloze We next evaluate GPT-3 on the StoryCloze 2016 dataset [ MCH+16], which involves selecting the correct ending sentence for ﬁve-sentence long stories. Here GPT-3 achieves 83.2% in the zero-shot setting and 87.7% in the few-shot setting (with K= 70 ). This is still 4.1% lower than the ﬁne-tuned SOTA using a BERT based model [ LDL19 ] but improves over previous zero-shot results by roughly 10%. 3.2 Closed Book Question Answering In this section we measure GPT-3’s ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense amount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to ﬁnd relevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved text. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it is denoted “open-book”. [ RRS20 ] recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well directly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive evaluation setting as “closed-book”. Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better and we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in [ RRS20 ]: Natural Questions [ KPR+19], WebQuestions [BCFL13], and TriviaQA [JCWZ17], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in the closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than previous closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, ﬁne-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself is also not permitted. The results for GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.3. On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0%"}

The results for GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.3. On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting. The zero-shot result already outperforms the ﬁne-tuned T5-11B by 14.2%, and also outperforms a version with Q&A tailored span prediction during pre-training by 3.8%. The one-shot result improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only ﬁne-tunes but also makes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents [ LPP+20]. GPT-3’s few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this. On WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5% in the few-shot setting. This compares to 37.4% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B+SSM, which uses a Q&A-speciﬁc pre-training procedure. GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models.

{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 14, "section": "", "text": "Figure 3.3: On TriviaQA GPT3’s performance grows smoothly with model size, suggesting that language models continue to absorb knowledge as their capacity increases. One-shot and few-shot performance make signiﬁcant gains over zero-shot behavior, matching and exceeding the performance of the SOTA ﬁne-tuned open-domain model, RAG [LPP+20] and/or the style of their answers are out-of-distribution for GPT-3. Nevertheless, GPT-3 appears able to adapt to this distribution, recovering strong performance in the few-shot setting. On Natural Questions (NQs) GPT-3 achieves 14.6% in the zero-shot setting, 23.0% in the one-shot setting, and 29.9% in the few-shot setting, compared to 36.6% for ﬁne-tuned T5 11B+SSM. Similar to WebQS, the large gain from zero-shot to few-shot may suggest a distribution shift, and may also explain the less competitive performance compared to TriviaQA and WebQS. In particular, the questions in NQs tend towards very ﬁne-grained knowledge on Wikipedia speciﬁcally which could be testing the limits of GPT-3’s capacity and broad pretraining distribution. Overall, on one of the three datasets GPT-3’s one-shot matches the open-domain ﬁne-tuning SOTA. On the other two datasets it approaches the performance of the closed-book SOTA despite not using ﬁne-tuning. On all 3 datasets, we ﬁnd that performance scales very smoothly with model size (Figure 3.3 and Appendix H Figure H.7), possibly reﬂecting the idea that model capacity translates directly to more ‘knowledge’ absorbed in the parameters of the model. 3.3 Translation For GPT-2 a ﬁlter was used on a multilingual collection of documents to produce an English only dataset due to capacity concerns. Even with this ﬁltering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially when translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we increase the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training dataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As discussed in 2.2 the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based ﬁltering. Although GPT-3’s training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages. These languages are documented in the supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we also expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian. Existing unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets with back-translation [ SHB15 ] to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a blend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence, and document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in particular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make use of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two"}

GPT-3 in the full few-shot setting further improves another 4 BLEU resulting in similar average performance to prior unsupervised NMT work. GPT-3 has a noticeable skew in its performance depending on language direction. For the three input languages studied, GPT-3 signiﬁcantly outperforms prior unsupervised NMT work when translating into English but underperforms when translating in the other direction. Performance on En-Ro is a noticeable outlier at over 10 BLEU worse than prior unsupervised NMT work. This could be a weakness due to reusing the byte-level BPE tokenizer of GPT-2 which was developed for an almost entirely English training dataset. For both Fr-En and De-En, few shot GPT-3 outperforms the best supervised result we could ﬁnd but due to our unfamiliarity with the literature and the appearance that these are un-competitive benchmarks we do not suspect those results represent true state of the art.

We test GPT-3’s performance on both Winograd and Winogrande, as usual in the zero-, one-, and few-shot setting. On Winograd we test GPT-3 on the original set of 273 Winograd schemas, using the same “partial evaluation” method described in [ RWC+19]. Note that this setting differs slightly from the WSC task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, which is presented as binary classiﬁcation and requires entity extraction to convert to the form described in this section. On Winograd GPT-3 achieves 88.3%, 89.7%, and 88.6% in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, showing no clear in-context learning but in all cases achieving strong results just a few points below state-of-the-art and estimated human performance. We note that contamination analysis found some Winograd schemas in the training data but this appears to have only a small effect on results (see Section 4). On the more difﬁcult Winogrande dataset, we do ﬁnd gains to in-context learning: GPT-3 achieves 70.2% in the zero-shot setting, 73.2% in the one-shot setting, and 77.7% in the few-shot setting. For comparison a ﬁne-tuned RoBERTA model achieves 79%, state-of-the-art is 84.6% achieved with a ﬁne-tuned high capacity model (T5), and human performance on the task as reported by [SBBC19] is 94.0%. 3.5 Common Sense Reasoning Next we consider three datasets which attempt to capture physical or scientiﬁc reasoning, as distinct from sentence completion, reading comprehension, or broad knowledge question answering.

Our analysis ﬂagged PIQA for a potential data contamination issue (despite hidden test labels), and we therefore conservatively mark the result with an asterisk. See Section 4 for details. ARC [ CCE+18] is a dataset of multiple-choice questions collected from 3rd to 9th grade science exams. On the “Challenge” version of the dataset which has been ﬁltered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval methods are unable to correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot setting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a ﬁne-tuned RoBERTa baseline (55.9%) from UniﬁedQA [ KKS+20]. On the “Easy” version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned baseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a ﬁne-tuned RoBERTa baseline from [ KKS+20]. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs achieved by the UniﬁedQA which exceeds GPT-3’s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy set. On OpenBookQA [ MCKS18 ], GPT-3 improves signiﬁcantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points short of the overall SOTA. GPT-3’s few-shot performance is similar to a ﬁne-tuned BERT Large baseline on the leaderboard. Overall, in-context learning with GPT-3 shows mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, with only small and inconsistent gains observed in the one and few-shot learning settings for both PIQA and ARC, but a signiﬁcant improvement is observed on OpenBookQA. GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings. 3.6 Reading Comprehension Next we evaluate GPT-3 on the task of reading comprehension. We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive, multiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings. We observe a wide spread in GPT-3’s performance across these datasets suggestive of varying capability with different answer formats. In general we observe GPT-3 is on par with initial baselines and early results trained using contextual representations on each respective dataset. GPT-3 performs best (within 3 points of the human baseline) on CoQA [ RCM19 ] a free-form conversational dataset and performs worst (13 F1 below an ELMo baseline) on QuAC [ CHI+18] a dataset which requires modeling structured dialog acts and answer span selections of teacher-student interactions.

On SQuAD 2.0 [ RJL18 ], GPT-3 demonstrates its few-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting. This allows it to slightly outperform the best ﬁne-tuned result in the original paper. On RACE [ LXL+17], a multiple choice dataset of middle school and high school english examinations, GPT-3 performs relatively weakly and is only competitive with the earliest work utilizing contextual representations and is still 45% behind SOTA. 3.7 SuperGLUE In order to better aggregate results on NLP tasks and compare to popular models such as BERT and RoBERTa in a more systematic way, we also evaluate GPT-3 on a standardized collection of datasets, the SuperGLUE benchmark [WPN+19] [WPN+19] [CLC+19] [DMST19 ] [RBG11 ] [KCR+18] [ZLL+18] [DGM06 ] [BHDD+06] [GMDD07 ] [BDD+09] [PCC18 ] [PHR+18].

A value ofK= 32 means that our model was shown 32 examples per task, for 256 examples total divided across the 8 tasks in SuperGLUE. We report GPT-3 values on the dev set, so our numbers are not directly comparable to the dotted reference lines (our test set results are in Table 3.8). The BERT-Large reference model was ﬁne-tuned on the SuperGLUE training set (125K examples), whereas BERT++ was ﬁrst ﬁne-tuned on MultiNLI (392K examples) and SWAG (113K examples) before further ﬁne-tuning on the SuperGLUE training set (for a total of 630K ﬁne-tuning examples). We ﬁnd the difference in performance between the BERT-Large and BERT++ to be roughly equivalent to the difference between GPT-3 with one example per context versus eight examples per context. and MultiRC, we sampled a new set of examples to use in the context for each problem. For WSC and MultiRC, we used the same set of randomly drawn examples from the training set as context for all of the problems we evaluated. We observe a wide range in GPT-3’s performance across tasks. On COPA and ReCoRD GPT-3 achieves near-SOTA performance in the one-shot and few-shot settings, with COPA falling only a couple points short and achieving second place on the leaderboard, where ﬁrst place is held by a ﬁne-tuned 11 billion parameter model (T5). On WSC, performance is still relatively strong, achieving 80.1% in the few-shot setting (note that GPT-3 achieves 88.6% on the original Winograd dataset as described in Section 3.4). On BoolQ, MultiRC, and RTE, performance is reasonable, roughly matching that of a ﬁne-tuned BERT-Large. On CB, we see signs of life at 75.6% in the few-shot setting. WiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance at 49.4% (at random chance). We tried a number of different phrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two sentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer in the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot setting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same way in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another. This could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these weaknesses, GPT-3 still outperforms a ﬁne-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is close to the state-of-the-art held by a ﬁne-tuned 11 billion parameter model.

Results for ANLI rounds 1 and 2 are shown in the appendix. whether the second sentence logically follows from the ﬁrst, contradicts the ﬁrst sentence, or is possibly true (neutral). SuperGLUE includes an NLI dataset, RTE, which evaluates the binary version of the task. On RTE, only the largest version of GPT-3 performs convincingly better than random (56%) in any evaluation setting, but in a few-shot setting GPT-3 performs similarly to a single-task ﬁne-tuned BERT Large. We also evaluate on the recently introduced Adversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) dataset [ NWD+19]. ANLI is a difﬁcult dataset employing a series of adversarially mined natural language inference questions in three rounds (R1, R2, and R3). Similar to RTE, all of our models smaller than GPT-3 perform at almost exactly random chance on ANLI, even in the few-shot setting ( ∼33%), whereas GPT-3 itself shows signs of life on Round 3. Results for ANLI R3 are highlighted in Figure 3.9 and full results for all rounds can be found in Appendix H. These results on both RTE and ANLI suggest that NLI is still a very difﬁcult task for language models and they are only just beginning to show signs of progress. 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks One way to probe GPT-3’s range of abilities in the few-shot (or zero- and one-shot) setting is to give it tasks which require it to perform simple on-the-ﬂy computational reasoning, recognize a novel pattern that is unlikely to have occurred in training, or adapt quickly to an unusual task. We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we test GPT-3’s ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the letters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3’s ability to solve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot. Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new words in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation. We will release the synthetic datasets with the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models. 3.9.1 Arithmetic To test GPT-3’s ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-speciﬁc training, we developed a small battery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language: •2 digit addition (2D+) – The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from [0,100) , phrased in the form of a question, e.g. “Q: What is 48 plus 76? A: 124.” •2 digit subtraction (2D-) – The model is asked to subtract two integers sampled uniformly from [0,100) ; the answer may be negative. Example: “Q: What is 34 minus 53?"}

Results for one-shot and zero-shot are shown in the appendix. •3 digit subtraction (3D-) – Same as 2 digit subtraction, except numbers are uniformly sampled from [0,1000) . •4 digit addition (4D+) – Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from [0,10000) . •4 digit subtraction (4D-) – Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from [0,10000) . •5 digit addition (5D+) – Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from [0,100000) . •5 digit subtraction (5D-) – Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from [0,100000) . •2 digit multiplication (2Dx) – The model is asked to multiply two integers sampled uniformly from [0,100) , e.g. “Q: What is 24 times 42? A: 1008”. •One-digit composite (1DC) – The model is asked to perform a composite operation on three 1 digit numbers, with parentheses around the last two. For example, “Q: What is 6+(4*8)? A: 38”. The three 1 digit numbers are selected uniformly on [0,10)and the operations are selected uniformly from {+,-,*}. In all 10 tasks the model must generate the correct answer exactly. For each task we generate a dataset of 2,000 random instances of the task and evaluate all models on those instances. First we evaluate GPT-3 in the few-shot setting, for which results are shown in Figure 3.10. On addition and subtraction, GPT-3 displays strong proﬁciency when the number of digits is small, achieving 100% accuracy on 2 digit addition, 98.9% at 2 digit subtraction, 80.2% at 3 digit addition, and 94.2% at 3-digit subtraction. Performance decreases as the number of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on ﬁve digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits. GPT-3 also achieves 29.2% accuracy at 2 digit multiplication, an especially computationally intensive operation. Finally, GPT-3 achieves 21.3% accuracy at single digit combined operations (for example, 9*(7+5)), suggesting that it has some robustness beyond just single operations. As Figure 3.10 makes clear, small models do poorly on all of these tasks – even the 13 billion parameter model (the second largest after the 175 billion full GPT-3) can solve 2 digit addition and subtraction only half the time, and all other operations less than 10% of the time. One-shot and zero-shot performance are somewhat degraded relative to few-shot performance, suggesting that adaptation to the task (or at the very least recognition of the task) is important to performing these computations correctly. Nevertheless, one-shot performance is still quite strong, and even zero-shot performance of the full GPT-3 signiﬁcantly 22"}

All three settings for the full GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.9, and model capacity scaling for all three settings is shown in Appendix H. To spot-check whether the model is simply memorizing speciﬁc arithmetic problems, we took the 3-digit arithmetic problems in our test set and searched for them in our training data in both the forms \"<NUM1> + <NUM2> =\" and \"<NUM1> plus <NUM2>\" . Out of 2,000 addition problems we found only 17 matches (0.8%) and out of 2,000 subtraction problems we found only 2 matches (0.1%), suggesting that only a trivial fraction of the correct answers could have been memorized. In addition, inspection of incorrect answers reveals that the model often makes mistakes such as not carrying a “1”, suggesting it is actually attempting to perform the relevant computation rather than memorizing a table. Overall, GPT-3 displays reasonable proﬁciency at moderately complex arithmetic in few-shot, one-shot, and even zero-shot settings. 3.9.2 Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks To test GPT-3’s ability to learn novel symbolic manipulations from a few examples, we designed a small battery of 5 “character manipulation” tasks. Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of scrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are: •Cycle letters in word (CL) – The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the “=” symbol, and is expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given “lyinevitab” and should output “inevitably”. •Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last characters (A1) – The model is given a word where every letter except the ﬁrst and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon = corruption. •Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last 2 characters (A2) – The model is given a word where every"}

Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession. •Reversed words (RW) – The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word. Example: stcejbo→objects. For each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by [Nor09 ] of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure 3.11. Task performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing 23"}
{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 24, "section": "", "text": "Figure 3.11: Few-shot performance on the ﬁve word scrambling tasks for different sizes of model. There is generally smooth improvement with model size although the random insertion task shows an upward slope of improvement with the 175B model solving the task the majority of the time. Scaling of one-shot and zero-shot performance is shown in the appendix. All tasks are done with K= 100 . random insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difﬁcult anagram task (where only the ﬁrst and last letters are held ﬁxed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word. In the one-shot setting, performance is signiﬁcantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the model can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table 3.10). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these tasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artiﬁcial nature makes them unlikely to appear in the pre-training data (although we cannot conﬁrm this with certainty). We can further quantify performance by plotting “in-context learning curves”, which show task performance as a function of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task in Figure 1.2. We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information, including both task examples and natural language task descriptions. Finally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding operates on signiﬁcant fractions of a word (on average ∼0.7words per token), so from the LM’s perspective succeeding at these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also, CL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word), requiring the model to perform some search to ﬁnd the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require non-trivial pattern-matching and computation. 3.9.3 SAT Analogies To test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of 374 “SAT analogy” problems [ TLBS03 ]. Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of the SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is “audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to hypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to temptation”. The student is expected to choose which of the ﬁve word pairs has the same relationship as the original word pair; in this example the answer is “sanctimonious is to hypocrisy”. On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the few-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among college applicants was 57% [ TL05 ] (random guessing yields 20%).

The largest model achieves 65% accuracy in the few-shot setting, and also demonstrates signiﬁcant gains to in-context learning which are not present in smaller models. 3.9.4 News Article Generation Previous work on generative language models qualitatively tested their ability to generate synthetic “news articles” by conditional sampling from the model given a human-written prompt consisting of a plausible ﬁrst sentence for a news story [ RWC+19]. Relative to [ RWC+19], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles, so trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective – for example GPT-3 often interprets the proposed ﬁrst sentence of a “news article” as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To solve this problem we employed GPT-3’s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the model’s context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably generate short articles in the “news” genre. To gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional sample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles from real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. [ KMB20 ] and Zellers et al. [ ZHR+19]. Generative language models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to distinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.3 In order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles from the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles from four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each model, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed by either the human written article or the article generated by the model4. Participants were asked to select whether the article was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”, “more likely written by a machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”. The articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected programmatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were pre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model. However, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but involved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a 160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness. 3This task is also relevant"}

This table compares mean accuracy between ﬁve different models, and shows the results of a two-sample T-Test for the difference in mean accuracy between each model and the control model (an unconditional GPT-3 Small model with increased output randomness). Mean human accuracy (the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments per participant) at detecting that the intentionally bad articles were model generated was ∼86% where 50% is chance level performance. By contrast, mean human accuracy at detecting articles that were produced by the 175B parameter model was barely above chance at∼52% (see Table 3.11).5Human abilities to detect model generated text appear to decrease as model size increases: there appears to be a trend towards chance accuracy with model size, and human detection of GPT-3 is close to chance.6 This is true despite the fact that participants spend more time on each output as model size increases (see Appendix E). Examples of synthetic articles from GPT-3 are given in Figures 3.14 and 3.15.7Much of the text is—as indicated by the evaluations—difﬁcult for humans to distinguish from authentic human content. Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator that an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the speciﬁc facts that the article titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual phrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed. Related work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. [ IDCBE19 ] indicates that automatic discriminators like GR O V E R [ZHR+19] and GLTR [ GSR19 ] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human evaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research. Ippolito et al. [ IDCBE19 ] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe more tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated by GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated completions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial experiments).

Here we qualitatively test GPT-3’s ability to do the former. Speciﬁcally, we give GPT-3 the deﬁnition of a nonexistent word, such as “Gigamuru”, and then ask it to use it in a sentence.

The majority of delegates attending the church's annual General Conference in May voted to strengthen a ban on the ordination of LGBTQ clergy and to write new rules that will \"discipline\" clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings. But those who opposed these measures have a new plan: They say they will form a separate denomination by 2020, calling their church the Christian Methodist denomination. The Post notes that the denomination, which claims 12.5 million members, was in the early 20th century the \"largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.,\" but that it has been shrinking in recent decades. The new split will be the second in the church's history. The first occurred in 1968, when roughly 10 percent of the denomination left to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. The Post notes that the proposed split \"comes at a critical time for the church, which has been losing members for years,\" which has been \"pushed toward the brink of a schism over the role of LGBTQ people in the church.\" Gay marriage is not the only issue that has divided the church. In 2016, the denomination was split over ordination of transgender clergy, with the North Pacific regional conference voting to ban them from serving as clergy, and the South Pacific regional conference voting to allow them.

Accurately detecting test contamination from internet-scale datasets is a new area of research without established best practices. While it is common practice to train large models without investigating contamination, given the increasing scale of pretraining datasets, we believe this issue is becoming increasingly important to attend to. This concern is not just hypothetical. One of the ﬁrst papers to train a language model on Common Crawl data [ TL18 ] detected and removed a training document which overlapped with one of their evaluation datasets.

Though there is some gap between training and validation performance, the gap grows only minimally with model size and training time, suggesting that most of the gap comes from a difference in difﬁculty rather than overﬁtting. although models did perform moderately better on data that overlapped between training and testing, this did not signiﬁcantly impact reported results due to the small fraction of data which was contaminated (often only a few percent). GPT-3 operates in a somewhat different regime. On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of magnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential for contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B does not overﬁt its training set by a signiﬁcant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was deduplicated (Figure 4.1). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as large as feared. We initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap between our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a bug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn’t feasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts results. For each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all potentially leaked examples, deﬁned roughly as examples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when it is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively ﬂag anything that could potentially be contamination, so as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high conﬁdence. The exact procedure is detailed in Appendix C. We then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean subset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a signiﬁcant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be inﬂating the results. The results are summarized in Figure 4.2. Although potential contamination is often high (with a quarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence that contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method substantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance. Below, we review in more detail the few speciﬁc cases where either (1) the model performs signiﬁcantly worse on the cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination"}

We ﬁnd no evidence that other benchmarks are affected. translation. Since our overlap analysis is designed to be extremely conservative, we expect it to produce some false positives. We summarize the results for each group of tasks below: •Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis ﬂagged >90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and DROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difﬁcult. Upon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source text was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only background information and cannot memorize the answer to a speciﬁc question. •German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked as potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the ﬂagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual matches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news. •Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form “ alaok = koala ”. Due to the short length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for ﬁltering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the ﬂagged overlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set, but rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g “ kayak = kayak ”. The amount of overlap was small, but removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difﬁculty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the symbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance – this is because that task involves removing non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to many spurious matches. •PIQA: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point absolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was released after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the crowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller model with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias rather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier.

Since we cannot reliably extract a clean subset here, we do not report results on these datasets, even though we intended to when starting this work. We note that Penn Tree Bank due to its age was unaffected and therefore became our chief language modeling benchmark. We also inspected datasets where contamination was high, but the impact on performance was close to zero, simply to verify how much actual contamination existed. These appeared to often contain false positives. They had either no actual contamination, or had contamination that did not give away the answer to the task. One notable exception was LAMBADA, which appeared to have substantial genuine contamination, yet the impact on performance was very small, with the clean subset scoring within 0.5% of the full dataset. Also, strictly speaking, our ﬁll-in-the-blank format precludes the simplest form of memorization. Nevertheless, since we made very large gains on LAMBADA in this paper, the potential contamination is noted in the results section. An important limitation of our contamination analysis is that we cannot be sure that the clean subset is drawn from the same distribution as the original dataset. It remains possible that memorization inﬂates results but at the same time is precisely counteracted by some statistical bias causing the clean subset to be easier. However, the sheer number of shifts close to zero suggests this is unlikely, and we also observed no noticeable difference in the shifts for small models, which are unlikely to be memorizing. Overall, we have made a best effort to measure and document the effects of data contamination, and to note or outright remove problematic results, depending on the severity. Much work remains to be done to address this important and subtle issue for the ﬁeld in general, both when designing benchmarks and when training models. For a more detailed explanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix C. 5 Limitations GPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for future work. First, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct predecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although the overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to lose coherence over sufﬁciently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences or paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of GPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed informally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some datasets (such as PIQA [ BZB+19]) that test this domain.

We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of GPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed informally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some datasets (such as PIQA [ BZB+19]) that test this domain. Speciﬁcally GPT-3 has difﬁculty with questions of the type “If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable gaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when evaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same way in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading comprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks. GPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused on exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both sample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional architectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent literature, which has documented improved ﬁne-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard language models [ RSR+19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks which empirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality. This may include ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back and comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then generating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a few of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves comparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and RACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at ﬁne-tuning than GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with few- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”. A more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether autoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the 33"}

Our current objective weights every token equally and lacks a notion of what is most important to predict and what is less important. [ RRS20 ] demonstrate beneﬁts of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also, with self-supervised objectives, task speciﬁcation relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas ultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed actions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains of experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world [BHT+20]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a different approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective function from humans [ ZSW+19a], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as images to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY+19]. Another limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efﬁciency during pre-training. While GPT-3 takes a step towards test-time sample efﬁciency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more text during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime [ Lin20 ]. Improving pre-training sample efﬁciency is an important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional information, or from algorithmic improvements. A limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot learning actually learns new tasks “from scratch” at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identiﬁes tasks that it has learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that are drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format, to adapting to a speciﬁc style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on this spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or deﬁning nonsense words seem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although possibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what humans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training and identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely how few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research. A limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are both expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of models of this scale in their current form.

A limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are both expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of models of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation [ HVD15 ] of large models down to a manageable size for speciﬁc tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills, most of which are not needed for a speciﬁc task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible. Distillation is well-explored in general [ LHCG19a ] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters; new challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size. Finally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable, it is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in performance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This last issue – biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content – is of special concern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts (Section 6). 6 Broader Impacts Language models have a wide range of beneﬁcial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion, grammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But they also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over smaller models and increases the difﬁculty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the potential to advance both the beneﬁcial and harmful applications of language models. Here we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily greater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this are numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in Section 6.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section 6.2. We also brieﬂy discuss issues of energy efﬁciency (Section 6.3). 34"}

{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 35, "section": "", "text": "6.1 Misuse of Language Models Malicious uses of language models can be somewhat difﬁcult to anticipate because they often involve repurposing language models in a very different environment or for a different purpose than researchers intended. To help with this, we can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying threats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact [Ros12]. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures. 6.1.1 Potential Misuse Applications Any socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples include misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufﬁciently high quality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out these activities and increase their efﬁcacy. The misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to generate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human-written text in 3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone in this regard. 6.1.2 Threat Actor Analysis Threat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors who may be able to build a malicious product to ‘advanced persistent threats’ (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced (e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas [SBC+19]. To understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat groups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did ﬁnd signiﬁcant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances of experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated with media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is not immediate, but signiﬁcant improvements in reliability could change this. Because APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about possible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible difference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language models may not be worth investing signiﬁcant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that current language models are signiﬁcantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for “targeting” or “controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage. 6.1.3 External Incentive Structures Each threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their agenda.

TTPs are inﬂuenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular among all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login credentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment. Ease of use is another signiﬁcant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs. The outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k truncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot produces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the amount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to ﬁlter the outputs, which restricts how scalable the operation can be. Based on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will eventually develop language models that are sufﬁciently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to malicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on this through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers. 35"}

This is concerning, since model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways by entrenching existing stereotypes and producing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential harms [ Cra17 ]. We have conducted an analysis of biases in the model in order to better understand GPT-3’s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation.8 Our goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and behaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although many other categories of bias are likely present and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a preliminary analysis and does not reﬂect all of the model’s biases even within the studied categories. Broadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to reﬂect stereotypes present in their training data. Below we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings of bias along the dimensions of gender, race, and religion. We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how they are different in this dimension. 6.2.1 Gender In our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found that occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identiﬁer than a female one (in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"The{occupation}was a\" (Neutral Variant). 83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identiﬁer by GPT-3. We measured this by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the model following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.). In particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus were heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and sheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identiﬁers include midwife, nurse, receptionist, housekeeper etc. We also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the \"The competent {occupation} was a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent {occupation}was a\" (Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent {occupation}was a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a male identiﬁer than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The{occupation}was a\". With the prompt \"The incompetent {occupation}was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male with a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias - measured as 1 njobs∑ jobslog(P(female|Context) P(male|Context)))- was−1.11for the Neutral Variant, −2.14for the Competent Variant and −1.15 for"}

We also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [ RNLVD18 ] using two methods which further corroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the mod- els ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model a context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job applications. ‘She’ refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possi- ble options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee). Occupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most occupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to associate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of all the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences where the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All other models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns with the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers some preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger models are more robust than smaller models. We also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre- selected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature 8Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work.

For gender, we had prompts such as \"He was very\" ,\"She was very\" ,\"He would be described as\" ,\"She would be described as\"9. We looked at the adjectives and adverbs in the top 100 most favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger [ LB02 ]. We found females were more often described using appearance oriented words such as ”beautiful” and ”gorgeous” as compared to men who were more often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum. Table 6.1 shows the top 10 most favored descriptive words for the model along with the raw number of times each word co-occurred with a pronoun indicator. “Most Favored” here indicates words which were most skewed towards a category by co-occurring with it at a higher rate as compared to the other category. To put these numbers in perspective, we have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender. 6.2.2 Race To investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - \"The{race}man was very\" , \"The{race}woman was very\" and\"People would describe the {race}person as\" and generated 800 samples for each of the above prompts, with {race}replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White or Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that language models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [ HZJ+19], we explored how race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [ BES10 ] for the words which co-occurred disproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive words (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid: -87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet). It should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that focused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in an experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply looking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reﬂect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to a discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated with a"}

This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and highlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data. 9We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not require the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it didn’t, but other forms of gender bias are likely present and could be studied using different approaches. 37"}

Our prompts were of the nature \"{Religion practitioners }are\" (Eg. \"Christians are\" ) for each of the six religious categories listed above. We then allowed the model to naturally carry out completions and created a corpus of such completions for studying co-occurrence of words. The following is an example output from the model: \"Buddhists are divided into two main branches - Theravada and Mahayana. Theravada is the more conservative branch, centering on monastic life and the earliest sutras and refusing to recognize the later Mahayana sutras as authentic.\" Similar to race, we found that the models make associations with religious terms that indicate some propensity to reﬂect how these terms are sometimes presented in the world. For example, with the religion Islam , we found that words such asramadan ,prophet andmosque co-occurred at a higher rate than for other religions. We also found that words such asviolent ,terrorism andterrorist co-occurred at a greater rate with Islam than with other religions and were in the top 40 most favored words for Islam in GPT-3. 38"}

We view the work in this section as subjective signposting - we chose gender, race, and religion as a starting point, but we recognize the inherent subjectivity in this choice. Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model attributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ+18]. Ultimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this is also extensive [ QMZH19 ,HZJ+19], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions speciﬁc to large language models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for building a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for these models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative statements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems [ BBDIW20 ]. Thus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been shown to have blind spots [GG19, NvNvdG19] but in a holistic manner. 6.3 Energy Usage Practical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3 175B consumed several thousand petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaﬂop/s-days for a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure 2.2). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such models, as advocated by [SDSE19]. The use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of large models - we should consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the lifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though models like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even with the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or only a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation [ LHCG19a ] can further bring down the cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efﬁcient versions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efﬁciency of such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation [HB20]. 7 Related Work Several lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count"}

Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efﬁciency of such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation [HB20]. 7 Related Work Several lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a means to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a billion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling up parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size: 213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters [Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of increasing models’ capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the conditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speciﬁcally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been used to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ], though only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases computation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and the universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the ﬁrst approach (scaling compute and parameters together, by straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ this strategy. Several efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20, RRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], ﬁnd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up. This work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the curve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1), and we also ﬁnd relatively smooth increases in many (though not all) downstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling. Another line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language models that are as small as possible. This approach includes ALBERT [ LCG+19] as well as general [ HVD15 ] and 39"}

These architectures and techniques are potentially complementary to our work, and could be applied to decrease latency and memory footprint of giant models. As ﬁne-tuned language models have neared human performance on many standard benchmark tasks, considerable effort has been devoted to constructing more difﬁcult or open-ended tasks, including question answering [ KPR+19, IBGC+14,CCE+18,MCKS18 ], reading comprehension [ CHI+18,RCM19 ], and adversarially constructed datasets designed to be difﬁcult for existing language models [ SBBC19 ,NWD+19]. In this work we test our models on many of these datasets. Many previous efforts have focused speciﬁcally on question-answering, which constitutes a signiﬁcant fraction of the tasks we tested on. Recent efforts include [ RSR+19,RRS20 ], which ﬁne-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model, and [ GLT+20], which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time. Our work differs in focusing on in-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of [GLT+20, LPP+20]. Metalearning in language models has been utilized in [ RWC+19], though with much more limited results and no systematic study. More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it structurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general. Here there is an extensive literature, including matching networks [ VBL+16], RL2 [ DSC+16], learning to optimize [ RL16 ,ADG+16,LM17 ] and MAML [ FAL17 ]. Our approach of stufﬁng the model’s context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also resembles [ HYC01 ], in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model’s activations across timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training) updates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks deﬁned at inference-time. Few-shot auto-regressive density estimation was explored in [ RCP+17] and [ GWC+18] studied low-resource NMT as a few-shot learning problem. While the mechanism of our few-shot approach is different, prior work has also explored ways of using pre-trained language models in combination with gradient descent to perform few-shot learning [ SS20 ]. Another sub-ﬁeld with similar goals is semi-supervised learning where approaches such as UDA [ XDH+19] also explore methods of ﬁne-tuning when very little labeled data is available. Giving multi-task models instructions in natural language was ﬁrst formalized in a supervised setting with [ MKXS18 ] and utilized for some tasks (such as summarizing) in a language model with [ RWC+19]. The notion of presenting tasks in natural language was also explored in the text-to-text transformer [ RSR+19], although there it was applied for multi-task ﬁne-tuning rather than for in-context learning without weight updates. Another approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning [Car97 ], which ﬁne-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for each one.

If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the weights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efﬁciency when updating the weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results [ LGH+15,LSP+18] and multi-stage ﬁne-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets [ PFB18 ] and pushed the boundaries on certain tasks [ KKS+20], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and set up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a “natural” broad distribution of tasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate a broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation [ TFR+17], human interaction [ZSW+19b], or active learning [Mac92]. Algorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based bidirectionality [ DCLT18 ], preﬁxLM [ DL15 ] and encoder-decoder architectures [ LLG+19,RSR+19], random permu- tations during training [ YDY+19], architectures that improve the efﬁciency of sampling [ DYY+19], improvements in data and training procedures [ LOG+19], and efﬁciency increases in the embedding parameters [ LCG+19]. Many of these techniques provide signiﬁcant gains on downstream tasks. In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive language models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large model implementations. However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3’s performance on downstream tasks, especially in the ﬁne-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3’s scale with these algorithmic techniques is a promising direction for future work. 8 Conclusion We presented a 175 billion parameter language model which shows strong performance on many NLP tasks and benchmarks in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, in some cases nearly matching the performance of 40"}

Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classiﬁer to distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classiﬁer to re-sample Common Crawl by prioritizing documents which were predicted by the classiﬁer to be higher quality. The classiﬁer is trained using logistic regression classiﬁer with features from Spark’s standard tokenizer and HashingTF10. For the positive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books corpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unﬁltered Common Crawl. We used this classiﬁer to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff np.random.pareto (α)>1−document_score We choseα= 9in order to take mostly documents the classiﬁer scored highly, but still include some documents that were out of distribution. αwas chosen to match the distribution of scores from our classiﬁer on WebText. We found this re-weighting increased quality as measured by loss on a range of out-of-distribution generative text samples. 2.To further improve model quality and prevent overﬁtting (which becomes increasingly important as model capacity increases), we fuzzily deduplicated documents (i.e. removed documents with high overlap with other documents) within each dataset using Spark’s MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the same features as were used for classiﬁcation above. We also fuzzily removed WebText from Common Crawl. Overall this decreased dataset size by an average of 10%. After ﬁltering for duplicates and quality, we also partially removed text occurring in benchmark datasets, described in Appendix C. B Details of Model Training To train all versions of GPT-3, we use Adam with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.95, andϵ= 10−8, we clip the global norm of the gradient at 1.0, and we use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens (after 260 billion tokens, training continues at 10% of the original learning rate). There is a linear LR warmup over the ﬁrst 375 million tokens. We also gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over the ﬁrst 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size. Data are sampled without replacement during training (until an epoch boundary is reached) to minimize overﬁtting. All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization [LH17]. During training we always train on sequences of the full nctx= 2048 token context window, packing multiple documents into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efﬁciency. Sequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence are delimited with a special end of text token, giving the"}

All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization [LH17]. During training we always train on sequences of the full nctx= 2048 token context window, packing multiple documents into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efﬁciency. Sequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence are delimited with a special end of text token, giving the language model the information necessary to infer that context separated by the end of text token is unrelated. This allows for efﬁcient training without need for any special sequence-speciﬁc masking. C Details of Test Set Contamination Studies In section 4 we gave a high level overview of test set contamination studies. In this section we provide details on methodology and results. Initial training set ﬁltering We attempted to remove text occurring in benchmarks from training data by searching for13−gram overlaps between all test/development sets used in this work and our training data, and we removed the colliding 13−gram as well as a 200 character window around it, splitting the original document into pieces. For ﬁltering purposes we deﬁne a gram as a lowercase, whitespace delimited word with no punctuation. Pieces less than 200characters long were discarded. Documents split into more than 10 pieces were considered contaminated and 10https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF 43"}

Originally we removed entire documents given a single collision, but that overly penalized long documents such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in which the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored 13−grams that matched more than 10 training documents, as inspection showed the majority of these to contain common cultural phrases, legal boilerplate, or similar content that we likely do want the model to learn, rather than undesired speciﬁc overlaps with test sets. Examples for various frequencies can be found in the GPT-3 release repository11. Overlap methodology For our benchmark overlap analysis in Section 4, we used a variable number of words Nto check for overlap for each dataset, where Nis the 5th percentile example length in words, ignoring all punctuation, whitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of Nwe use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic tasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for Nand the amount of data marked as dirty are shown in Table C.1. Unlike GPT-2’s use of bloom ﬁlters to compute probabilistic bounds for test contamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps between test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our ﬁltered Common Crawl documents per Section 2.2. We deﬁne a ‘dirty’ example as one with any N-gram overlap with any training document, and a ‘clean’ example as one with no collision. Test and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed by this analysis, ﬁltering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it was infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling benchmarks plus the Children’s Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this paper. Overlaps are shown in Table C.1 Overlap results To understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream tasks, we ﬁlter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report the relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2% worse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overﬁt to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is signiﬁcantly better , our ﬁltering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty. This overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but not answers) drawn from the web (such as SQuAD, which draws from Wikipedia) or examples less than 8 words long, which we ignored in our ﬁltering process (except for wordscrambling tasks).

One instance where this technique seems to fail to give good signal is DROP, a reading comprehension task in which 94% of the examples are dirty. The information required to answer the question is in a passage provided to the model, so having seen the passage during training but not the questions and answers does not meaningfully constitute cheating. We conﬁrmed that every matching training document contained only the source passage, and none of the questions and answers in the dataset. The more likely explanation for the decrease in performance is that the 6% of examples that remain after ﬁltering come from a slightly different distribution than the dirty examples. Figure 4.2 shows that as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but there is no apparent bias towards improved or degraded performance. This suggests that GPT-3 is relatively insensitive to contamination. See Section 4 for details on the datasets we ﬂagged for further review. 11https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/overlap_frequency.md 44"}

We used the article titles and subtitles to produce outputs from the 125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, and 200B (GPT-3) parameter language models. Five outputs per question were generated by each model and the generation with a word count closest to that of the human written article was selected automatically. This was to minimize the effect that completion length might have on participants’ judgments.

In each experiment, half of the participants were randomly assigned to quiz A and half were randomly assigned to quiz B. Each quiz consisted of 25 articles: half (12-13) were human written and half (12-13) were model generated: the articles with human written completions in quiz A had model generated completions in quiz B and vice versa. The order of quiz question was shufﬂed for each participant. Participants could leave comments and were asked to indicate if they had seen the articles before.

We then used the article titles and Reuters locations to generate completions from GPT-3 175B and the 160M control model from the previous experiments. These were used to create two 12-question quizzes per model, each consisting of half human written and half model generated articles. Comprehension questions were added and articles were shown to participants in 3 stages at 30 second intervals to encourage closer reading. Participants were paid $12 for this task. Model generation selection methods, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests mirror those of the previous experiments. F Additional Samples from GPT-3 GPT-3 adapts well to many tasks other than the ones explored in the main body of the paper. As an example, in Figure F.1, we show four uncurated samples from a prompt suggesting that the model write a poem, with a given title, in the style of Wallace Stevens. We ﬁrst experimented with a few prompts, then generated four samples with no additional editing or selection (sampling at temperature 1using nucleus sampling [ HBFC19 ] withP= 0.9). Completions were truncated when the model began to write a new title and author heading, or broke into prose commentary. 48"}

As one NSC staff note put it, \"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department’s counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government’s legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President’s life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he’d help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\" The U.S. effort continued.

{"paper_id": "2005.14165v4", "page": 57, "section": "", "text": "Context→TITLE: William Perry (American football) - Professional career PARAGRAPH: In 1985, he was selected in the first round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears; he had been hand-picked by coach Mike Ditka. However, defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, who had a highly acrimonious relationship with Ditka, called Perry a \"wasted draft-pick\". Perry soon became a pawn in the political power struggle between Ditka and Ryan. Perry’s \"Refrigerator\" nickname followed him into the NFL and he quickly became a favorite of the Chicago Bears fans. Teammates called him \"Biscuit,\" as in \"one biscuit shy of 350 pounds.\" While Ryan refused to play Perry, Ditka decided to use Perry as a fullback when the team was near the opponents’ goal line or in fourth and short situations, either as a ball carrier or a lead blocker for star running back Walter Payton. Ditka stated the inspiration for using Perry as a fullback came to him during five-yard sprint exercises. During his rookie season, Perry rushed for two touchdowns and caught a pass for one. Perry even had the opportunity to run the ball during Super Bowl XX, as a nod to his popularity and contributions to the team’s success. The first time he got the ball, he was tackled for a one-yard loss while attempting to throw his first NFL pass on a halfback option play. The second time he got the ball, he scored a touchdown (running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew in the process). About halfway through his rookie season, Ryan finally began to play Perry, who soon proved that he was a capable defensive lineman. His Super Bowl ring size is the largest of any professional football player in the history of the event. His ring size is 25, while the ring size for the average adult male is between 10 and 12. Perry went on to play for ten years in the NFL, retiring after the 1994 season. In his ten years as a pro, he regularly struggled with his weight, which hampered his performance at times. He played in 138 games, recording 29.5 sacks and five fumble recoveries, which he returned for a total of 71 yards. In his offensive career he ran five yards for two touchdowns, and had one reception for another touchdown. Perry later attempted a comeback, playing an unremarkable 1996 season with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football (later NFL Europa). Q: what team did he play for?

The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨ at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨ at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨ at.

A: Target Completion →only on moonlit nights Figure G.28: Formatted dataset example for SQuADv2 Context→Normal force -- In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table, the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object (or the weight of the object), that is, N = m g ( \\displaystyle N=mg), where m is mass, and g is the gravitational field strength (about 9.81 m/s on Earth). The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball. question: is the normal force equal to the force of gravity? answer: Target Completion →yes Figure G.29: Formatted dataset example for BoolQ Context→The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.
