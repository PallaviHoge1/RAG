# RAG
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for question answering on AI research papers, fully offline and privacy-friendly. It allows users to ask natural-language questions and get accurate, context-aware answers directly sourced from a small collection of research PDFs such as Transformers, RAG, and GPT-3 papers.
